# Analyzing Amazon consumer Behaviour Dataset

### Executive Summary:

Machine learning models were used to analyze Amazon customer purchasing behavior using a Kaggle dataset. Random Forest delivered the highest accuracy (76%), while hyperparameter tuning notably improved k-Nearest Neighbors. The study highlights the importance of model selection and tuning and shows that e-commerce purchasing decisions are influenced by multiple demographic, behavioral, and product-related factors.
